### Adding keyboard shortcut to the webclipper in Chrome
At the end of the extension management page in the Chrome browser there is a link called "Keyboard shortcuts". See the red area of the screenshot below.

This link opens a dialog where you can set a direct keyboard shortcut, which will open the popup area of an extension. Since currently the main functionality of the this area in TagSpaces is to scrap the current webpage, I choose for myself the shortcut `ctrl+s`, which overwrites the default save as functionality of Chrome browser. You can choose of course any other key combination, like for example `ctrl+shift+s`.

So now I can conviniently save and tags any page by just clicking this shortcut combination.

### Download location for web clippings

In order to be asked everytime, where you want to save the scapped web content, make sure to activate the checkbox "Ask where to save each file before downloading" in the advanced Chrome settings.
