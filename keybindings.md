Keyboard shortcuts are combinations of two or more keys that you can use to perform a specific task that would typically require more than one mouse click. They are very useful and can make it easier to work with your software, saving you time and effort as you work with TagSpaces and other applications.

To use a keyboard shortcut, hold down one or more keys while pressing the last key of the shortcut. For example, to use the shortcut **Ctrl** + **C** on Windows and Linux or **Command** - **C** on Mac OS X, hold down **Ctrl** button, press **C** and then release both keys.

TagSpaces like a much of modern software also provides a range of keyboard shortcuts for better experience with it. To access the list of available shortcuts:

Please run TagSpaces and on the main menu, please click on **View** and choose **Settings**.
