# Organize your data with tags

## File Tagging based on filename{#file-tagging}

TagSpaces supports tagging of files in a multi platform way. It uses basically the name of the file to save this kind of meta information. As an example if you want to add the tags `vacation` and `alps` to a image named `IMG-2653.jpg`, the application will simply rename it to `IMG-2653[vacation alps].jpg`. File renaming is of course very controversial decision (see our users [discussion]), with its own limitations (on some operating systems the file path length is limited to ca. 256 characters), but it allows a portable way for adding tags on every platform (even cloud based).

## Tagging with Drag & Drop

The user interface of the application is design to be usable on touch screens, but for the pure desktop, we support many drag & drop operation such as:

* Adding tags from the tag groups to files in the list & grid perspectives and to the file viewer
* Moving tags from one tag group to another
