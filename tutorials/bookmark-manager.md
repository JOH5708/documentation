# Bookmark manager
TagSpace comes with a build in viewer for `.url`, `.website` and `.desktop` files.
This is basically enabling you to use TagSpaces as a bookmark manager.
`.url` files can be created for example in Windows by dragging and dropping over the desktop a website from your browser.
`.desktop` files are the alternative to the `.url` files in Ubuntu.

Once you open such a file, a button with an URL will be shown in the viewer, allowing you to open this URL in your default browser.
