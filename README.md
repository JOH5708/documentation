## What is TagSpaces ?
TagSpaces is an open source, cross-platform, no backend, no login, no cloud personal data manager and file navigator. It helps organize your files, photos and other documents with tags on different platforms and/or devices, according to your own preferences and following your own logic, by using the same smart and friendly interface everywhere. Here is a short introducing video showing TagSpaces in action:
